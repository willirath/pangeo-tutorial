# Pangeo Tutorial Materials

This repository tutorial materials for half-day workshops that showcase Pangeo JupyterHub deployments. The `notebooks` directory has Jupyter notebooks that illustrate key python libraries including geopandas, xarray, dask, and intake. You can run these notebooks interactively on BinderHub services like [MyBinder.org](https://mybinder.org). **Note that these are emphermal computing environments on Public infrastructure, so you may lose work, and don't store passwords!**

Notebooks in subfolders `amazon-web-services` and `google-cloud` combine all these Python libraries and use cluster configurations and datasets stored on Google Cloud (GCP) or Amazon Cloud (AWS). The following binder links launch a [predefined computational environment](https://hub.docker.com/r/pangeo/pangeo-notebook/tags) in different Cloud data centers, allowing us to upload our computation rather than download data:

- **[About Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/):** Pangeo is a community effort for big data in the geosciences using Python. A key component of the Pangeo effort is the improved integration of Xarray and Dask to enable analysis of very large datasets.
- **[About Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/):** Project Jupyter exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages. The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.
- **[About Xarray](http://xarray.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html):** Xarray is an open source project and Python package that aims to bring the labeled data power of pandas to the physical sciences, by providing N-dimensional variants of the core pandas data structures.
- **[About Dask](http://dask.pydata.org/en/latest/index.html):** Dask is a flexible parallel computing library for analytic computing.
- **[About Geopandas](http://geopandas.org):** Geopandas is a library to facilitate analysis of geospatial vector data
- **[About Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html):** Intake is a cataloging system designed to "Take the pain out of data access and distribution"
